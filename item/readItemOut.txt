Although a fierce protest campaign was launched by local residents, authorities, individuals and national institutions, all efforts to halt the building of the new reservoir ultimately failed.  On 1 August 1957 the Liverpool Corporation Act was passed.  Work began on the site three years later and was completed in August 1965.","cy":"Tynnwyd y ffotograff gan Geoff Charles.\n\nYm 1955, cyhoeddodd Corfforaeth Lerpwl ei bwriad i adeiladu cronfa dd\u0175r newydd yng Nghwm Tryweryn, gan foddi pentref Capel Celyn, i'r gogledd o dref y Bala.  Lansiwyd ymgyrch ddygn i wrthwynebu'r cynlluniau gan drigolion ac awdurdodau lleol, unigolion a sefydliadau cenedlaethol,  ond er gwaethaf pob ymdrech ni lwyddwyd i rwystro'r datblygiad ac ar 1 Awst 1957 pasiwyd Deddf Corfforaeth Lerpwl.  Dechreuodd y gwaith ar y safle dair mlynedd yn ddiweddarach ac fe gwblhawyd y cynllun ym mis Awst 1965."},"author":{"id":2889,"name":"Gathering The Jewels"},"creator":"Charles, Geoff","owner":"The National Library of Wales","publisher":"","copyright":[{"holder":{"en":"The National Library of Wales","cy":"The National Library of Wales"},"year":"2001","type":"copyright"}],"license":{"reproducedPermission":{"en":"The National Library of Wales","cy":"Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru"},"additionalText":[],"type":"ARR"},"tags":["meeting","protest","reservoir"],"when":[],"date":"+0019561004999999","what":[],"learn":[],"locations":[{"lat":"52.914834611604","lon":"-3.598905198423","description":{"en":"'Save Tryweryn' Rally organised by Plaid Cymru, Bala, 4 October 1956","cy":"'Save Tryweryn' Rally organised by Plaid Cymru, Bala, 4 October 1956"}}],"files":[{"originalFilename":"GTJ11786_2.jpg","url":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/sites/default/files/images/2014/February/GTJ11786_2.jpg","type":"image","target_id":"319135"}],"original_item_url":{"en":null,"cy":null},"guid":"a23aa775-7a70-40c8-a066-f8845e7790bb","publisher_ref":"GTJ11786"}
